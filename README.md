# GAM576 - GPU Architecture
## Description
GAM576 focused on real-time application GPU development. Topics included GPU pipeline, data parallelization, hierarchy data flow on GPU, asset compression, non-graphics data processing, graphics rendering and data conversion.

## Project Descriptions
* Hybrid Game Engine (MS1)
  * 2D Game Engine with Sprites and Font System
  * 3D Game Engine
  * 3D Animation
* Model Skinning (MS2)
  * Extract and Export Skinned Model Data
    * Creates a runtime format
    * Adjusts number of influences from N to 4 per vertex
  * GPU Code for Skinned Data
    * Refactored existing game engine to handle skinned data
    * GPU system to have skinned data automated
* Advanced Animation (MS3)
  * Animation Extractor Tool
    * Exports animation data for a FBX file
    * Compresses the animation data
    * Convert runtime to prcess compressed data
    * Replays animations using GPU code

## Instructions To View Hybrid Game Engine with Model Skinning
